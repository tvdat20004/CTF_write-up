    "\n",
    "- Carol invented a keyed hash algorithm. The key $k = (k_1, k_2, ..., k_6)$ for this hash function is a binary vector of length 6, the input of hash function $p$ is a sequence of digits. It should be divided into blocks of length 6. If the length of the sequence is not a multiple of 6 then it can be completed with 1, 2, 3, and so on up to the necessary length. It should be divided into blocks of length 6. Let say the input is $p=(p_1, p_2, ..., p_6)$, the hash value of each block is calculated by this formula: $$H(k, p)=\\sum_{i=1}^{6}(-1)^{k_i}*p_i$$ Say $n_1, n_2, ..., n_k$ is the result of such calculations of each block, then the final hash value is calculated as $$H=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(-1)^i*n_i$$\n",
    "- Our goal is to propose a simplest algorithm how to get a collision of the first order for any known input sequence P if the\n",
    "key K is unknown. By the way, find the shortest collision for the sequence from the example, $P = 134875 512293$."

    "- We can form the hash function into a formula like this: $$H(k, p)=\\sum_{i=1}^{6}(-1)^{k_i}*\\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1^j)*p_{i+6j} \\right)$$\n",
    "Because the key $K$ is unknown, we have to find an algorithm that find collision for all case of $K$, which means all sums of $(-1^j)*p_{i+6j}$ of 2 message have to be respectively equal. \n",
    "- In my algorithm, I firstly find the minimum numbers of blocks in the collision. I do it like this:\n",
    "\t- Calculate the range of sum $(-1^j)*p_{i+6j}$ in each case of number of blocks.\n",
    "\t- Calculate all sums $(-1^j)*p_{i+6j}$ of input sequence, say $n_i$\n",
